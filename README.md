ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§

Project to detect and measure rainfall.

This repository contains micro controller source code and `.stl` files for the project's 3D printed components.

A description of the project build can be found on the [Rain Sensors](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com/projects/rain-sensors/) page of the [Cahamo](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com) website.

## Project Overview

There are three components of this project: a rain detector and a rain gauge along with a junction box to combine the wiring of the previous two components.

### Rain Detector

This component of the project simply sounds an alarm when rainfall is detected.

The project includes an `.stl` file for the detector's 3D printed housing. This is an original design.

### Rain Gauge

The rain gauge component measures rainfall.

The project will include both the microcontroller source code and `.stl` files for the gauge's 3D printed components.

### Junction Box

The junction box provides a means of connecting the wiring from the detector and gauge.

The project includes and `.stl` file for the 3D printed junction box housing. This is an original design.
